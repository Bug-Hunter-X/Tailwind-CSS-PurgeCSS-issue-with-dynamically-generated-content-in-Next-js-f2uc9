# Tailwind CSS PurgeCSS Issue with Dynamic Content in Next.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS with Next.js (or similar frameworks) where PurgeCSS, responsible for removing unused styles, fails to correctly identify and include styles for dynamically generated content. This leads to missing styles in the application.

## Problem

When components generate content server-side or client-side dynamically, PurgeCSS might not detect the classes used in these dynamic elements, causing these elements to lack styling in the final rendered output.

## Solution

The primary solution is to ensure that PurgeCSS can correctly identify all the classes in your application, even those rendered dynamically.  This may involve adjusting your PurgeCSS configuration, adding custom selectors to include the necessary styles, or using a different approach to handle dynamic styling.
